                    <p>On May 2017, Steam introduced new gifting system. Two biggest changes are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gifts can't be stored in inventory anymore, but have to be sent to receiver instantly (or with automatic delay).</li>
                        <li>Gifts can't be sent from country with cheaper prices to country with more expensive prices (around 10% difference in price).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These changes affect every purchase since May 2017.</p>
                    <p>More info: <a href='https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1301948399254001159'>Steam Blog Post</a></p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Right now Steam and publishers thave their own region restriction systems:</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Steam - every Steam Store gift purchase is restricted by rule: can't gift from cheaper country to more expensive one; CD-Key's are unaffected.</li>
                        <li>Publishers - can region lock Steam Store gifts and CD-Keys, although right now publisher's region locks on Steam Store are overwrited by Steam's region lock system.</li>
                    </ul>

                    { this.props.type === 'app' &&
